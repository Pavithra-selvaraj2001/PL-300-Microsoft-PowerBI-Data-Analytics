To Analyse Data, core analytic components are divided into following categories.

        2. Diagnostic
        3. Predictive
        4. Prescriptive
        5. Cognitive
Descriptive Analytics:
        Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. 
        Techniques used to summarize large semantic models to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

      Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and regression.

Prescriptive Analytics:
      Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about which action taken to achieve a goal or target by using predictive analysis.
      Techniques rely on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large semantic models.

Cognitive Analytics:
      Cognitive analytics combines intelligent technologies like AI and machine learning to analyze data and make decisions in a way that mimics human thought processes.
      Techniques like pattern recognition and natural language processing to extract insights and make predictions.
